## Introduction

The Sunscan is a revolutionary spectroheliograph designed to allow you to capture images of the Sun in minutes, directly from your smartphone. This complete and autonomous device is the result of several months of work by our team of enthusiasts. With the Sunscan, you will be able to explore the wonders of the Sun like never before. Thanks to this dedicated application, you will be able to control the Sunscan directly from your smartphone or tablet, making the experience even more intuitive and accessible. You will be able to make observations very simply and obtain images of our star automatically without any special knowledge, showing prominences, flares or even sunspots...

This project is currently under active development, and contributions are welcome!
